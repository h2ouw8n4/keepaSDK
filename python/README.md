# openapi-client
The Keepa API offers numerous endpoints.  Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key in the keepa portal. All requests must be issued as a HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep-Alive connection.  Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.

This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 1.0.0
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen

```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:

```

### Setuptools

(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint


# create an instance of the API class
api_instance = openapi_client.CategoryApi(openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration))
key = 'key_example' # str | Your private API key.
domain = 56 # int | Integer value for the Amazon locale you want to access. (1-com, 2-co.uk, 3-de, 4-fr, 5-co.jp, 6-ca, 7-cn, 8-it, 9-es, 10-in, 11-com.mx, 12-com.br, 13-com.au)
category = 56 # int | The category node id of the category you want to request. For batch requests a comma separated list of ids (up to 10, the token cost stays the same). Alternatively you can specify the value 0, which will retrieve a list of all root categories.
parents = 56 # int | Whether or not to include the category tree for each category. (1 = include, 0 = do not include.)

try:
    # Returns Amazon category information from Keepa API.
    api_response = api_instance.category(key, domain, category, parents)
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling CategoryApi->category: %s\n" % e)

```
