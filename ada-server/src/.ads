--  Keepa API
--  The Keepa API offers numerous endpoints.  Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key in the keepa portal. All requests must be issued as a HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep_Alive connection.  Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.
