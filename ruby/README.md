# openapi_client

OpenapiClient - the Ruby gem for the Keepa API

The Keepa API offers numerous endpoints.  Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key in the keepa portal. All requests must be issued as a HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep-Alive connection.  Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.

This SDK is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 1.0.0
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.RubyClientCodegen
For more information, please visit [https://keepa.com/#!api](https://keepa.com/#!api)

## Installation

### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

```shell
gem build openapi_client.gemspec
```

Then either install the gem locally:

```shell
gem install ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem
```
(for development, run `gem install --dev ./openapi_client-1.0.0.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

    gem 'openapi_client', '~> 1.0.0'

### Install from Git

If the Ruby gem is hosted at a git repository: https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID, then add the following in the Gemfile:

    gem 'openapi_client', :git => 'https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git'

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

```shell
ruby -Ilib script.rb
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) procedure and then run the following code:
```ruby
# Load the gem
require 'openapi_client'

api_instance = OpenapiClient::CategoryApi.new
key = 'key_example' # String | Your private API key.
domain = 56 # Integer | Integer value for the Amazon locale you want to access. (1-com, 2-co.uk, 3-de, 4-fr, 5-co.jp, 6-ca, 7-cn, 8-it, 9-es, 10-in, 11-com.mx, 12-com.br, 13-com.au)
category = 56 # Integer | The category node id of the category you want to request. For batch requests a comma separated list of ids (up to 10, the token cost stays the same). Alternatively you can specify the value 0, which will retrieve a list of all root categories.
parents = 56 # Integer | Whether or not to include the category tree for each category. (1 = include, 0 = do not include.)

begin
  #Returns Amazon category information from Keepa API.
  result = api_instance.category(key, domain, category, parents)
  p result
rescue OpenapiClient::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling CategoryApi->category: #{e}"
end

```
