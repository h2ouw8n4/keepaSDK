# openapi
The Keepa API offers numerous endpoints.  Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key in the keepa portal. All requests must be issued as a HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep-Alive connection.  Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.

This Dart package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```dart
import 'package:openapi/api.dart';


var api_instance = new CategoryApi();
var key = key_example; // String | Your private API key.
var domain = 56; // int | Integer value for the Amazon locale you want to access. (1-com, 2-co.uk, 3-de, 4-fr, 5-co.jp, 6-ca, 7-cn, 8-it, 9-es, 10-in, 11-com.mx, 12-com.br, 13-com.au)
var category = 56; // int | The category node id of the category you want to request. For batch requests a comma separated list of ids (up to 10, the token cost stays the same). Alternatively you can specify the value 0, which will retrieve a list of all root categories.
var parents = 56; // int | Whether or not to include the category tree for each category. (1 = include, 0 = do not include.)

try {
    var result = api_instance.category(key, domain, category, parents);
    print(result);
} catch (e) {
    print("Exception when calling CategoryApi->category: $e\n");
}
