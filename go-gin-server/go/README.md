# Go API Server for openapi

The Keepa API offers numerous endpoints.  Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key in the keepa portal. All requests must be issued as a HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep-Alive connection.  Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it openapi 
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
