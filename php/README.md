# OpenAPIClient-php
The Keepa API offers numerous endpoints.  Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key in the keepa portal. All requests must be issued as a HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep-Alive connection.  Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.

This PHP package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: 1.0.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PhpClientCodegen

  }
}
```

```

## Tests

```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');



$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Api\CategoryApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client()
);
$key = 'key_example'; // string | Your private API key.
$domain = 56; // int | Integer value for the Amazon locale you want to access. (1-com, 2-co.uk, 3-de, 4-fr, 5-co.jp, 6-ca, 7-cn, 8-it, 9-es, 10-in, 11-com.mx, 12-com.br, 13-com.au)
$category = 56; // int | The category node id of the category you want to request. For batch requests a comma separated list of ids (up to 10, the token cost stays the same). Alternatively you can specify the value 0, which will retrieve a list of all root categories.
$parents = 56; // int | Whether or not to include the category tree for each category. (1 = include, 0 = do not include.)

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->category($key, $domain, $category, $parents);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling CategoryApi->category: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
